This 'analysis-model' project is a library to read static analysis reports into a Java object model. 
Currently it is used only by [Jenkins' warnings plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Warnings+Plugin). 
Since this library has no dependencies to the Jenkins project it might be used by other static analysis visualization 
tools as well in the future.
