    This library provides a Java object model to read, aggregate, filter, and query static analysis reports.
    It is used by Jenkins' warnings next generation plug-in to visualize the warnings of individual builds.
    Additionally, this library is used by a GitHub action to autograde student software projects based on a given set of
    metrics (unit tests, code and mutation coverage, static analysis warnings).
